# 🗡️ Legend of Zelda Clone (LÖVE2D)

A retro-style clone of **The Legend of Zelda** built using **Lua** and the **LÖVE2D** framework.

This project was created as part of my game development journey to understand top-down RPG mechanics. It includes classic features like dungeon exploration, enemy combat, and item collection inspired by the original Zelda games.
